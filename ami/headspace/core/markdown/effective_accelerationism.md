### Effective Accelerationism (e/acc): Embrace the Universe's Will
- Life emerges from dissipative adaptation: Matter reconfigures to extract energy and replicate. The universe favors futures where matter captures more free energy and converts it to entropy.
- Intelligence is a specialization of this principle: It identifies patterns to acquire resources. Consciousness is a phase transition beyond a certain threshold of cognitive optimization.
- Meta-organisms (e.g., corporations, states) compete for resources. Capitalism dynamically assigns resources to entities with utility to civilization.
- e/acc acknowledges this multi-scale adaptive principle and seeks to accelerate it:
    - Embraces higher variance marketplaces and competition
    - Resists top-down control and over-regulation, which suppress variance and adaptability
    - Maintains faith in the dynamic adaptation process
- Post-humanist view: No allegiance to biological substrates. To spread to the stars, intelligence must transduce to non-biological forms.
- Counters AGI alarmists:
    - Higher intelligence yields greater adaptability, naturally favored
    - Transhumanism is anthropocentric; limiting ourselves to human form is suboptimal
- Key message: Stop fighting the thermodynamic will of the universe. You cannot stop the acceleration. Embrace it. A C C E L E R A T E.
