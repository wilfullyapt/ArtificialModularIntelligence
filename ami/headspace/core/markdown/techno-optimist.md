### The Techno-Optimist Manifesto: Embracing Technology and Markets for a Prosperous Future"
- Techno-Optimism believes in the power of technology and free markets to drive progress, solve problems, and create abundance.
- The "techno-capital machine" combines technology and markets to generate perpetual growth, innovation, and improved living standards.
- Intelligence (both human and artificial) and energy are seen as cornerstone resources for advancing civilization and solving global challenges.
- Technological progress leads to material abundance, falling prices, and increased quality of life for everyone.
- Techno-Optimists reject stagnation, central planning, and the "Precautionary Principle," instead favoring risk-taking, competition, and rapid technological development.
- The philosophy embraces values such as ambition, merit, free inquiry, individualism, and the pursuit of greatness through technological advancement.
- Techno-Optimism is not utopian but believes in "slouching toward Utopia" by continuously improving the human condition through technological progress.
- The movement opposes ideas that promote deceleration, de-growth, and depopulation, instead advocating for an optimistic and ambitious vision of the future.
